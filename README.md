# BT-Playing-Card-KATA

**BT Technical Task**

Thank you for reviewing my technical task.

### Things to Note
I aimed to complete this challenge within approximately 3 hours. I was able to implement most of the core logic based on the requirements. The UI integration has not been added at the time of submission.


### Approach
I followed a TDD pproach, adhering to the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. I prioritized code quality over rushing to implement all the requirements.


### Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was during the planning phase. I initially wanted to demonstrate my architectural skills, as I felt they would be relevant to the role, and attempted to follow a DDD (Domain-Driven Design) approach. However, this approach required significant setup time. Midway through, I realized it was taking longer than expected, and I wanted to avoid overcomplicating the solution, especially since a full DDD implementation was not explicitly required by the KATA.  

Additionally, refactoring took longer than anticipated. I had planned to refactor things like replacing magic numbers with named variables, but due to time constraints, I had to scale back these changes.

In Addtion, I found that the refacotring took longer than expected. I wanted to more refactoring around things like putting magic numbers into variables ect, but in the interest of time I had to cut these changes short 

### What I Learned
I am satisfied with my decision to simplify the architecture. While I am a strong advocate for building scalable and resilient solutions from the outset, I also recognized that simplicity better matched the intention of this task.

### File Structure
Here is the file structure of my DDD-based solution:

_Unit Tests should split also be split into seperate test projects for domain, web, application ect. But I didn't initially implement this._
