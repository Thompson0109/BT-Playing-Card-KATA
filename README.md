# BT-Playing-Card-KATA
BT Technical Task

Thank you for reviewing my Technical task.

Things to Note: 
I tried to keep the challange to around 3 hours. I was able to get most of the logic down from the requirments. The UI intergration is still yet to be added at the time I am submitted this. 


**Approach**: 
I wanted to the TDD approach. Making sure I was following the red green refactor approach. I didn't want to rush forward and make everything in the requirments list with the trade off bieng poor code quality. 

**Challenges**: 
The biggest challange I faced was when I was planning out the task. I originally wanted to show my architetual skills as I felt as though It would be relevant to the role. I tried to follow a DDD approach. The issue with this approach is that it takes a lot of setup time. Half way through setting it up, I not only realised that it was taking longer than expected. But I also wanted to make sure I wasn't overcomplicating things. I also was weary that this technically wasn;t explicitly mentioned the KATA requirements. 

In Addtion, I found that the refacotring took longer than expected. I wanted to more refactoring around things like putting magic numbers into variables ect, but in the interest of time I had to cut these changes short 
**
What I have learned**: 
I am happy with my choice to revert the architecture of the solution to something more simple. Although I am a strong advocate for creating scalable and resiliant solutions from the get go, I can also understand and appreciate that this was not the intention of the task.

Here is the file structure of my DDD solution
